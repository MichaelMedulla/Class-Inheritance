This program is not designed to do much but to get us used to class inheritance and how it works.
There is the suber Animal class and the subclasses Fish and Zebra.
Each class has their own fields and methods and the fish ones are private while the others are all public.
There is a print statement in each method.
After the required methods and fields are set, a main method is created in the Animal class.
The objects myAnimal, myFish, and myZebra are all created in main.
Also in main, all public methods from the subclasses are called into the main method to run them.
Because the Fish method is private, both the fish object and method are not used and not read.
